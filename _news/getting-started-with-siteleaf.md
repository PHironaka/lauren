If you're just getting started with Siteleaf you're in for a treat. The new [Version Two](http://v2.siteleaf.com) of the service—still in Beta as of late 2015—is chock-full of nice touches. Of course Jekyll integration is the big news here but the folks at [Oak](oak.is) have a consistently clean and pleasing approach to UI that makes the service a pleasure to use. This is especially important if you're a developer getting ready to hand the site off to clients and/or content managers.
