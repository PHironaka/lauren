[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Siteleaf](://www.siteleaf.com), two great tastes that taste great together. You get the power, flexibility, and portability of Jekyll—and you get the easy to use, client friendly, GUI goodness of Siteleaf. What’s not to like?



Speaking of point and click, [this site](https://github.com/BryanSchuetz/siteleaf-jekyll) is a freebie starter theme to help you quickly get started with Siteleaf and Jekyll. Use it as a starting point for your own customizations, or just change the title and use it as is, or ignore it altogether.

gh the minimal [setup](/setup/) to get the theme up and running with Siteleaf, and start writing! Not sure what I'm talking [about](/about/)?
